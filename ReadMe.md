# AgroFed

## Problem Statement
* AI based real time identification of Crop Nutrient Disasters in agricultural crops

## Idea
* Learn collaboratively from users (farmers) across demographics, to keep the crops healthy.

## Solution
* Design a federated (machine) learning solution, which will be dealing with the real-time and contemporary problems.

## Motivation
* Like humans and animals, there does not exist a doctor for the crops. Crops suffer from unpredictable diseases, in wake of global warming, and diverse climatic conditions. It motivates us to think for designing a solution for nurturing the crops, based on the learnings over the immediate past, and suggest/predict the best.

## Methodology
* A Distributed server.
* Users feed data to their mobiles.
* Do local data preprocessing, extract features, train model.
* Post their local trained model to the distributed server.
* All users receive the updates from the distributed server of all other subscribed users.
* The whole process runs iteratively.

## Results expected
* Query any issue.
* Get suggestion/prediction.
